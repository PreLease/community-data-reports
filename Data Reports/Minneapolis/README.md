## Minneapolis Housing Open Data Portal Directory

We recommend using Python Jupyter Notebook to view ipnyb files. The portal includes 
- **Datasets Folder:** include raw data and reporting data
- **Workbook File:** covers all the data preparation from extraction, transformation, and export
- **Reporting File:** the file that is used to generate the report. (there is plenty of code)
- **Error-Log Folder:** Any documentated errors and inconsistencies in the raw dataset. We encourage local ofiicals to look over
