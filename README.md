# community-data-reports

Welcome! My name is Abu Nayeem, I'm the lead programmer, co-founder of Prelease, and community organizer in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Also, I'm the founder of the Saint Paul Open Data Initiative, where I took public data to create interactive reports and create dialogue within the local community. For example, I was able to use local crime data to develop a [petition](https://chng.it/xXpjKB8r) to pressude local lawmakers to address catalytic converter thefts, among other community reports (view here). I'm proud the PreLease will be doing a public open data initative as well!

### About PreLease 

Prelease is a service that validates the rental history between tenants and landlords. Prior to signing a lease, a tenant can determine if the housing provider is responsible, and the housing provider can determine if the tenant is responsible, which can make pre-screen barriers, such as credit checks and expensive deposits unnecessary. Our service is designed to intentionally benefit the responsible parties so they can negotiate a favorable lease agreement. Prelease intentionally seeks to partner with the general public, community organizations, and goverment agencies providing quality community reports, and providing data services.

**Currently, we have a Minneapolis report, and, in the process, of creating a Saint Paul report.**

## Open Housing Data Initiative Mission

1) We take public open data from various sources and provide meaningful **interative reports** so community members, researchers, and  lawmakers, can take local action. We seek to create a local housing dashboard
2) We provide valuable **public data services**. We clean the data, test for quality assurance,and inform the local agencies of potential errors that are found. There is an error table for each city's folder. 
3) We want to survey tenants and housing providers, and provide in-house aggregate data to the public as part of our service
4) We are an **Open-Source**. All raw code, data, and analysis are repeatable and available to the public. We encourage other programmers and developers to contribute to this project. Currently, we are just using Jupyter notebooks.

## Meaningful Questions

1) Am I able to view and explore the rental market in my neighborhood?
2) Who are the housing providers with poor housing conditions?
3) What is the distribution of residential housing in the city?
4) How much and where is new construction being implemented?
5) Who are the large housing providers and how concentrated are they?
